** A bit of theory
objects and hashes
plumbing and porcelain
staging and working directory


** Basic commands
git checkout - not your father's checkout
git branch - your new best friend
git merge - many flavors of win
  --ff - fast forward = easy merge
  --no-ff - non fast forward = traditional merge
git rebase - like merge, but better (sometimes)
git reset

** Repositories
git init - creating a repository
.gitignore file
git clone - now you have an origin
