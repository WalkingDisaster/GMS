** CREATING A REPOSITORY
> mkdir first :: create a working directory
> cd first :: navigate to the directory
> git init :: create a git repository in your working directory
> git status :: check the status of the repository (should be in its initial state)
> vim README :: create a new file with content
    This is my first Git commit.
> git status :: should show untracked file
> git commit :: rejected because no files staged

** WORKING DIRECTORY AND STAGING
> git add README :: stages README for commit
> git commit :: commits README to the repository
> git status :: should show no changes
> git log :: shows the commit history
> git show [hash from the log] :: shows details of the commit
> vim README :: add another line (any text will do)
> git status :: should show the unstaged change
> vim README :: remove the line you just added
> git status :: should show no changes again

** ROLLING BACK CHANGES
> vim README :: add some text
> git add . :: stages all files with changes
> git status :: should show the file is staged
> git reset :: unstages the file
> git status :: shows it as unstaged once again
> git reset --hard :: replaces the working directory files with the HEAD files
> vim README :: add some junk text
> git commit -a :: the -a will stage and commit any files in one step
> git log :: you should see two commits now
> git reset --hard HEAD^ :: resets the head to the commit previous to the head commit
> git log :: you should now see that the last commit was erased

** IGNORING FILES AND CLEANING YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY
> vim .gitignore :: add ignore patterns
    .gitignore
    *ignoreme
    /foldertoignore
    /foldertoignore/*.txt
> touch ignoremeplease :: won't be ignored because it doesn't fit the pattern
> touch youshouldignoreme :: will be ignored
> mkdir foldertoignore :: will be ignored
> touch foldertoignore/bar.txt :: will be ignored
> touch foldertoignore/foo.bar :: ignored, because files under an ignored directory are also ignored
> git status :: you only see "ignoremeplease"
> git reset --hard :: what the heck, all the files are still there
> git commit -a :: why didn't it add the untracked file?
> git clean -n :: tells me what a git clean would remove
> git clean -f :: actually executes the clean
> git status :: we're clean again
> ls our ignored files are still there
> touch ignoremeplease
> git clean -dxn :: now you can see that we will remove ignored files too
> git clean -dxf :: executes the clean
> ls :: now we're really clean

** WORKING WITH BRANCHES
> git branch spanish :: creates a branch called "spanish"
> git branch :: shows all local branches, the branch you're on has an asterisk
> git checkout spanish :: this is not your father's checkout
> git branch :: we're not on the spanish branch
> vim README :: add the line below
    Este es mi compromiso git primero.
> git diff :: shows what you changed
> git diff --stat :: shows only the filenames of the changes
> git commit -am "added the line in espagnol" :: -am means to stage any changes and commit with the message that follows.
> git diff :: no difference now (between working directory and HEAD)
> git diff master :: shows the difference between the current branch and

** MERGING
> git checkout master :: go back to the master branch
> git merge spanish :: merge the spanish branch into master
> git diff spanish :: no differences
> git reset --hard HEAD^ :: lets go back, because I want to show you something
> vim file.txt :: add anything
> git add . :: add the new file to the index
> git commit -am "added file.txt" :: commit the file
> gitk :: shows the history of this branch
> gitk --all :: shows all branches
> git merge spanish :: merges the spanish branch
> git reset --hard HEAD^ :: let's do it again in a different way
> gitk --all :: back to where we were
> git rebase spanish :: applies the commits to the current head one at a time
> gitk --all :: do you see what happened here?

** MERGE CONFLICTS
> vim README :: make changes on the first line
> git commit -am "making breaking changes on the master branch" :: commit
> git checkout spanish :: go to the spanish branch
> vim README :: make conflicting changes on the first line
> git commit -am "more breaking changes" :: commit
> git checkout master :: go back to master
> git merge spanish :: try to merge. you'll have merge conflicts
> git mergetool :: resolve the merge
> git reset --hard :: let's go back (you could have committed the changes, but we're going to do a rebase just for practice)
> git rebase spanish :: let's rebase spanish
> git mergetool :: do the merge
> git rebase :: see your options
> git rebase --continue :: finish the rebase

** STASHING A DIRTY WIRKING DIRECTORY AND INDEX
> git checkout spanish :: let's make some more changes
> vim some_file.txt :: add any text
> git add . :: stage the file
> vim README :: make some changes
> git status :: we have unstaged and staged changes
> git stash :: not ready to commit, but put this away for a while
> git status :: we're clean again
> ls :: no stray files
> gitk --all :: notice the funkyness? we have one commit for staging and one for the working directory
> git stash pop :: pops the stashed commits
> git status :: whoa, it's all there again!
> ls :: seriously, it's all there
> git commit -am "just for prosperity" :: let's put these changes in the repository

** TAGGING
> git checkout master :: go back to master
> git tag v0.1-lightweight :: create a lightweight tag
> git tag v0.1-annotated -a :: create an annotated tag
> git tag v0.1-signed -s :: create a signed tag
> git tag :: shows the tags
> git show v0.1-lightweight
> git show v0.1-annotated
> git show v0.1-signed

** CLONING
> cd .. :: let's go back so we can create another repository
> git clone first second :: make a clone of the first repository, call it "second"
> cd second :: navigate to the "second" repository
> git remote :: show remote repositories. "origin" is usually used to denote the repository that this one was clone from
> vim .git/config :: notice the configuration fo the master branch

** GETTING CHANGES FROM A REMOTE
> cd ../first/ :: go back to first
> mvim README :: make a change
> cd ../second/ :: back to see our changes
> git fetch origin :: gets the remote branches from origin. Since it's origin, "git fetch" would have worked (without the origin part)
> git branch -a :: show all branches, including remote branches
> git merge origin/master :: merge origin master into local master
> vim README :: just to prove it
> cd ../first/
> mvim README :: add some more stuff
> git commit -am "more changes in first"
> cd ../second/
> git pull origin master :: again, just "git pull" would have worked here since origin is the remote for master
> vim README :: to prove it once again

** CREATE A TRACKING BRANCH
> git branch -t spanish origin/spanish :: create a remote tracking branch that tracks to the "spanish" branch on origin
> git branch :: there's a branch here
> vim .git/config :: see how it's configured?

** PUSHING OLD SKUUL STYLE
> cd .. :: go back up
> git clone --bare first central :: clone a bare repository into central
> cd central :: let's look around
> ls :: these are the contents of the git directory.  There's no working directory here.
> cd second
> vim README :: make more changes
> git commit -am "changes to be pushed" :: commit the changes
> git push origin master :: we can't do this because our origin has a working directory (and once again, just "git push" would have worked here)
> vim .git/config :: we're going to change our origin change the "url" line under "[remote "origin"]" to:
    url = /Users/michael/proj/gms-demo/central
> git push :: pushed the changes to the remote
> cd .. :: back up a level
> git clone central third :: gonna clone central so we can see the change we just made.
> cd third
> mvim README :: here are our changes
